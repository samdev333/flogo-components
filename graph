When building GraphQL APIs for a scenario like credit card accounts where you need to retrieve data from multiple entities (accounts, customers, and cards), it's essential to design an efficient schema that reflects the relationships between these entities. Here's an example of how you can structure the GraphQL schema:

graphql
Copy code
type Account {
  id: ID!
  accountNumber: String!
  balance: Float!
  # Other account fields...
  customers: [Customer!]!
}

type Customer {
  id: ID!
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
  email: String!
  # Other customer fields...
  cards: [Card!]!
}

type Card {
  id: ID!
  cardNumber: String!
  expirationDate: String!
  # Other card fields...
}

type Query {
  account(id: ID!): Account
  customer(id: ID!): Customer
  card(id: ID!): Card
}
In this schema:

Each Account type has an array of Customer objects representing the customers associated with that account.
Each Customer type has an array of Card objects representing the cards owned by that customer.
The Query type defines entry points to fetch individual accounts, customers, and cards by their IDs.
When federating these schemas using Apollo Federation, you typically maintain separate schemas for each entity (account, customer, card), and then use federation directives to indicate how these schemas should be stitched together to form a unified graph.

For example, you might have a separate schema for accounts, customers, and cards, and then use federation directives like @key, @requires, and @provides to define relationships and dependencies between these schemas. Here's a high-level overview:

graphql
Copy code
# Account schema
type Account @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  accountNumber: String!
  balance: Float!
  # Other account fields...
}

# Customer schema
type Customer @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
  email: String!
  # Other customer fields...
  account: Account! @provides(fields: "id")
}

# Card schema
type Card @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  cardNumber: String!
  expirationDate: String!
  # Other card fields...
  customer: Customer! @provides(fields: "id")
}

# Gateway schema stitching
extend type Account @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID! @external
  customers: [Customer!]! @requires(fields: "id")
}

extend type Customer @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID! @external
  cards: [Card!]! @requires(fields: "id")
}

extend type Card @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID! @external
}
In this example:

Each type (Account, Customer, Card) specifies a unique identifier (@key directive) used for federation.
The @provides directive indicates which fields each type provides to downstream services.
The @requires directive specifies which fields each type depends on from upstream services.
In the gateway schema stitching section, we extend each type and specify how they're connected and dependent on each other.
This approach allows you to maintain separate schemas for each entity while defining relationships and dependencies between them in the federated super graph.

*************
If the customer subgraph is returning multiple items in the response based on the account ID, it suggests a one-to-many relationship between accounts and customers. In such cases, you can still stitch the schemas together in a federated architecture, but you need to adjust the schema design and federation directives accordingly.

Here's how you can modify the schema and federation directives to handle this scenario:

graphql
code
# Account schema
type Account @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  accountNumber: String!
  balance: Float!
  # Other account fields...
}

# Customer schema
type Customer @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
  email: String!
  # Other customer fields...
  account: Account! @provides(fields: "id")
}

# Card schema
type Card @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  cardNumber: String!
  expirationDate: String!
  # Other card fields...
  customer: Customer! @provides(fields: "id")
}

# Gateway schema stitching
extend type Account @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID! @external
  customers: [Customer!]! @requires(fields: "accountNumber") # Adjust based on the actual field used to link accounts and customers
}

extend type Customer @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID! @external
}

extend type Card @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID! @external
}
In this modified schema:

The Account type remains the same, representing individual accounts.
The Customer type represents individual customers but no longer contains an array of customers under each account.
The customers field in the extended Account type now returns an array of customers based on the account ID.
The @requires directive in the customers field specifies that the downstream service requires the accountNumber (or any other field used to link accounts and customers) to resolve the array of customers.
This approach enables you to stitch together the schemas while accommodating the one-to-many relationship between accounts and customers.

Here's an example of how the response might look like for the given GraphQL schema:

json
code
{
  "data": {
    "account": {
      "id": "123",
      "accountNumber": "ACCT123",
      "balance": 5000.0,
      "customers": [
        {
          "id": "CUST456",
          "firstName": "John",
          "lastName": "Doe",
          "email": "john.doe@example.com",
          "cards": [
            {
              "id": "CARD001",
              "cardNumber": "1234567890123456",
              "expiryDate": "12/25"
            },
            {
              "id": "CARD002",
              "cardNumber": "9876543210987654",
              "expiryDate": "10/24"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "id": "CUST789",
          "firstName": "Jane",
          "lastName": "Smith",
          "email": "jane.smith@example.com",
          "cards": [
            {
              "id": "CARD003",
              "cardNumber": "1111222233334444",
              "expiryDate": "08/23"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
In this updated example:

Each customer object within the customers array now contains an additional cards array.
Each card object in the cards array includes id, cardNumber, and expiryDate fields.
The cards array provides card information for each customer associated with the account.

You can still support a consumer who only wants customer data with the above schema. In GraphQL, clients can specify exactly what data they need, and the server will respond accordingly. If a consumer only wants customer data without card information, they can simply request the relevant fields for customers in their GraphQL query.

For example, consider the following GraphQL query:

graphql
code
query {
  account(id: "123") {
    id
    accountNumber
    balance
    customers {
      id
      firstName
      lastName
      email
    }
  }
}
With this query, the server will only return the specified fields for customers associated with the account, without including card information. This allows clients to retrieve only the data they need, resulting in more efficient network communication and reduced overhead.


If one of the consumers specifically wants only card data, you can support that with the provided schema. In GraphQL, clients can tailor their queries to request only the fields they need, allowing them to fetch card data exclusively. Here's how you can structure the GraphQL query:

graphql
code
query {
  account(id: "123") {
    id
    accountNumber
    balance
    cards {
      id
      cardNumber
      cardType
      expirationDate
    }
  }
}
With this query, the server will respond with card data associated with the specified account, without including customer information. This flexibility allows clients to retrieve precisely the data they require, resulting in efficient and targeted data retrieval.

Here are the sample responses for both use cases:

Response for fetching only customer data:
json
code
{
  "data": {
    "account": {
      "id": "123",
      "accountNumber": "ACC123",
      "balance": 5000,
      "customer": {
        "id": "CUST456",
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "john@example.com",
        "phone": "+1234567890"
      }
    }
  }
}
Response for fetching only card data:
json
code
{
  "data": {
    "account": {
      "id": "123",
      "accountNumber": "ACC123",
      "balance": 5000,
      "cards": [
        {
          "id": "CARD789",
          "cardNumber": "1234567890123456",
          "cardType": "Credit",
          "expirationDate": "12/25"
        },
        {
          "id": "CARD987",
          "cardNumber": "9876543210987654",
          "cardType": "Debit",
          "expirationDate": "06/24"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
These responses contain only the requested data, either customer information or card information, based on the client's query.
