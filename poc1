1. Automate Process to Extract Data from Payment Remittance Advice Messages and Match to Invoices
Develop a system to automate the extraction of data from payment remittance advice messages and match it to corresponding invoices. The scope includes creating a UI for uploading remittance advice messages and a dashboard to display matched and unmatched invoices, automating the data extraction and matching process, and ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.

2. Build a Sales Assistant Offering Real-Time Conversational Interaction and Research
Create a sales assistant to provide real-time conversational interactions and research capabilities to enhance sales team efficiency and effectiveness. The scope covers developing a Teams app for user interaction with the assistant, integrating real-time conversational capabilities, and enabling backend logic to support internal database queries and external API interactions.

3. Automate Account Maintenance Requests Received from Customers via E-Mail
Develop a system to automate the processing of account maintenance requests received via email, reducing operational costs significantly. The scope involves creating an interface for tracking the status of maintenance requests, automating email processing and response generation, and implementing a workflow to handle the business logic and update request statuses efficiently.



As part of our ongoing GenAI pilot with various vendors, leadership has reviewed the initial metrics provided. While we recognize the value in the parameters outlined—such as sprint velocity, test case coverage, automation accuracy, and legacy code conversion outcomes—leadership has expressed interest in incorporating additional insights to better gauge the pilot’s overall impact.

In particular, we would like to include the following metrics alongside the vendor-supplied data:

Developer Perception of Productivity (POE): To assess how developers perceive their productivity post-integration of GenAI solutions.
Product Manager and Engineering Manager POE: Capturing how managers view team efficiency and productivity improvements.
Code Review Efficiency: Measuring improvements in the code review process speed.
Code Quality: Evaluating the quality of code generated by the GenAI solutions.
Pre-release Defect Fixing: Tracking any increase in defects addressed before release.
Post-release Defect Reduction: Monitoring the decrease in production defects after code deployment.
We believe that these additional metrics will provide a comprehensive view of the pilot's impact on team productivity, code quality, and overall engineering efficiency. Please ensure that these metrics are captured and reported in subsequent evaluations.
