To respectfully inquire about our approach towards enhancing our payment systems, I'd like to understand our strategic direction for the modernization of our payment core infrastructure. Recognizing that our current core relies on legacy mainframe systems, which have their limitations in scaling, and considering our ongoing efforts to develop our digital platforms using modern technology stacks and cloud services that still interface with these mainframe systems, how are we envisioning the integration of a FinTech mindset within our organization? Furthermore, in light of the competitive landscape, where entities such as Marqeta, Zeta, Galileo, Stripe, and SynapseFI are making significant strides, could you share insights on how we plan to maintain our competitive edge without a complete overhaul of our core systems?
